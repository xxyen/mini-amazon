1. We dicussed the inital protocol with UPS, but we found there's something need to be modified, so we refined the protocol.

2. The communication between the frontend and the backend is a little difficult. We discussed different plans and chose to use
a shared database.

3. It's difficult to test functions without data in the database. So we made a data generated script to generate data when
starting the frontend.

4. We used a loop to keep asking orders' status in the database. This caused some uncertain problems related to the concurrency.
Finally, we figured it out and added the timer to make sure statements are executed in the correct order.

5. When testing receiving messages from the world, we found the message couldn't be correctly parsed. So we changed the parsing 
function, and it finally worked.

6. The frontend display pages had some unsolved issues when tested. We managed to make it work correctly.

7. When testing the communication with UPS, we encountered some bugs related to the message passing. We successfully solved the 
problem after making some changes.

8. We added the product feedback feature to the frontend, but they were not displayed as expected after the user added a new one.
We managed to solve it after carefully debugging.
